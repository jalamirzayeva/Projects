                <h2>Out of office: what the homeworking revolution means for our cities</h2>
                <h3>Employees’ reluctance to return to full-time commuting after a year of Covid means change is afoot
                    for companies</h3>

                <h4>Susanna* has spent most of lockdown in back-to-back Zoom meetings. It is a major change for the
                    senior banker, who used to commute to London from her home in rural Lincolnshire and regularly
                    travelled across the country to meet business customers face to face.
                    <br><br>

                    The 55-year-old does not miss the 5.30am alarms or spending three nights a week away from her
                    husband and son. And she appreciates the way the bank’s management has banned calls between noon and
                    1pm – now dubbed “golden hour” – and cuts video meetings off after 50 minutes to give staff a brief
                    buffer. But working from home has felt relentless, and after nearly a year she is longing to return
                    to some sort of normality.
                    <br><br>
                    Following the pandemic, Susanna is hoping for a middle ground where she can experience the buzz of
                    central London and cross-country travel, while enjoying the extra downtime remote working permits.
                    Her ideal scenario would be to meet her team of six just once a month in the office, and she would
                    not be afraid to challenge bosses if they asked for more.
                </h4>
                <h1>“Why would we need to do that,” she said, “with everything that we’ve proved over the past year in
                    terms of how we’re able to conduct our business, and do it much quicker?”</h1>
                <h4>Susanna is not alone in her desire for more flexibility in her post-pandemic life. Indeed many
                    analysts believe a shift to remote working was already under way, with coronavirus accelerating it
                    by around a decade.
                    <br><br>
                    Seven in 10 UK employees who have been working remotely during Covid-19 told a survey by Boston
                    Consulting Group that they felt as productive at home as in the workplace. More than half (53%) of
                    workers said they would prefer a hybrid model in future, splitting their time equally between their
                    desk and a remote location.
                    <br><br>
                    Boris Johnson provided little new guidance on managing the return to workplaces last Monday when he
                    presented his roadmap out of lockdown, promising only to review the advice on working from home by
                    late June. Most social restrictions are expected to be relaxed in midsummer, but businesses are not
                    anticipating a large-scale recolonisation of offices before September, provided coronavirus case
                    rates continue to decline.
                    <br><br>
                    By then, office-based workers will have spent almost 18 months away from the watercooler, and few
                    expect work to return to the way it was.

                    JMW. “As a business you have to make yourself attractive,” she said, “and that is the challenge for

                    Most firms are expected to embrace a hybrid model, which will be more difficult to implement and

                    future of work at Boston Consulting Group (BCG). “You have to think about people’s families and
                    needs, people’s preferences, the practicalities, the guardrails you want to provide. There is quite
                    a co-ordination job needed to make this work, and that’s before you think what tech do we need
                    where, and how we will redesign our space.”

                    able to spend time with her son as soon as she closes her laptop.
                    <br><br>
                    Her life before the pandemic consisted of commuting to various city-centre offices run by her
                    employer, a high-street lender.
                    <br><br>
